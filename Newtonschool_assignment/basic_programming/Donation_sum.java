//After the decimation, the world went into chaos. People had to rebuild the planet so Shield
// came up with a donation strategy. They feel all the rich guys need to donate more than the poor
// guys. So, they make a rule. They would make a donation list in which the donation of each person
// would be shown. But the rule is that a person canâ€™t pay less than what has already been paid
// before them.Find the extra amount each person will pay, and also, tell shield the total amount of donation.
//Sample Input 2:-
//7
//10 20 30 40 30 20 10

//Sample Output 2:-
//0 0 0 0 10 20 30
//220
